//what is "everything"?
The OpenShift Plus policy set contains two `PolicySets` that are deployed. The OpenShift Plus policy set installs everything onto the  hub cluster. The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security secured cluster services and the Compliance Operator are deployed onto all {ocp-short} managed clusters.

Before you apply the policy set, complete the following steps:

. To allow for subscriptions to be applied, you must apply and set the policy to enforce the `policy-configure-subscription-admin-hub.yaml` policy.

. Install the Policy Generator Kustomize plugin by following the installation instructions. It is recommended to use Kustomize v4.5+.
Policies are installed to the policies namespace. Make sure the placement bindings match this namespace for the hub and other managed clusters. Example yaml to apply a ManagedClusterSetBinding for the policies namespace.
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
    name: default
    namespace: policies
spec:
    clusterSet: default
oc apply -f managed-cluster.yaml 
Apply the policies using the kustomize command or subscribing to a fork of the repository and pointing to this directory. See the details for using the Policy Generator for more information. The command to run is kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins  | oc apply -f -

Note: For any components of OpenShift Plus that you do not wish to install, edit the policyGenerator.yaml file and remove or comment out the policies for those components.
